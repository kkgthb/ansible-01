# This "main.yml" file is a role, which one can recognize because:
# 1. It does not have any dashes up top.
# 2. Its top-level entries invoke "tasks" or "blocks" of tasks (in this case, just tasks).
#    (To be specific:  it invokes two tasks, back-to-back, in order from top to bottom of the file.)
#    (A full list of built-in tasks available when using Ansible Core 
#        is at https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/index.html#plugin-index)

# Within the playbook, this "Query file/folder status" list item invokes a "task," which one can recognize because:
# 1. It does not contain any "hosts", "tasks", "roles," or "block" properties.
- name: 'READ:  Query "{{ fsexistsrole__param_path }}" file/folder status.'
  ansible.builtin.stat:
    path: "{{ fsexistsrole__param_path }}"
  register: "stat_param_path"
# Within the playbook, this "Assert that the file/folder exists" list item invokes a "task," which one can recognize because:
# 1. It does not contain any "hosts", "tasks", "roles," or "block" properties.
- name: 'READ:  Assert that a file/folder named "{{ fsexistsrole__param_path }}" exists.'
  ansible.builtin.assert:
    that:
      - "stat_param_path.stat.exists"
    fail_msg: '"{{ fsexistsrole__param_path }}" does not exist but should.'
    success_msg: '"{{ fsexistsrole__param_path }}" exists.  Well done.'
